MATLAB Exercises and DemonstrationsChapter 11.	foucalt.m:  Demonstration script showing the trajectory of a Foucalt pendulum of very long period in both rotating and non-rotating coordinates for an initial condition in which the pendulum is displaced from the vertical. Note that because the pendulum mechanism is rotating with the earth the path is not a straight line in inertial space as is sometimes incorrectly claimed. Even when the pendulum is placed at the pole the trajectory is not a straight line in inertial space since the pendulum end is initially displaced off the pole so has finite angular momentum. 2.	coriolis.m: [Problems M1.1, M1.2, and M1.3]. Script for computing and displaying constant angular momentum trajectories with and without the curvature terms, using built in 4th order accurate differential equation solver. Requires functions xprim1.m and xprim2.m. There are three factors that lead to departure of the trajectories from closed circles.  (i) The first is the dependence of the Coriolis force on sine of latitude, which causes a stronger deflection (shorter radius of curvature) for the portion of the trajectory at higher latitudes. (ii) The second is that the "curvature term" involving  increases the deflection force when u > 0 and decreases the deflection force when u < 0. (iii) The third factor results from the convergence of the meridians at high latitudes. A parcel moving at constant speed eastward will cross more longitudes at high latitude than at low latitude since .  The first two effects tighten the curvature at high latitudes and weaken it at low latitudes, so cause a westward drift. The third effect tends to cause an eastward drift. The westward tendency dominates when the curvature effect is included. 4.	const_ang_mom_traj1.m: [Problem M1.4] Script to animate constant angular momentum trajectories in latitude-longitude space with initial longitude = 0.
